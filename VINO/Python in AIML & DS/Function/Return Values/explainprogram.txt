Certainly! Letâ€™s break down the provided Python program that calculates the mean and standard deviation of a list of numbers:

```python
def calculate_statistics(numbers):
    """
    Calculate the mean and standard deviation of a list of numbers.

    :param numbers: List of numbers.
    :return: Tuple containing the mean and standard deviation.
    """
    # Compute the mean (average)
    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

    # Compute the variance using a generator expression
    variance = sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in numbers) / len(numbers)

    # Standard deviation is the square root of the variance
    std_dev = variance ** 0.5

    return mean, std_dev

# Example usage:
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
mean, std_dev = calculate_statistics(numbers)
print(f"Mean: {mean}")
print(f"Standard Deviation: {std_dev}")
```

### Detailed Explanation:

#### 1. **Function Definition: `calculate_statistics`**

```python
def calculate_statistics(numbers):
    """
    Calculate the mean and standard deviation of a list of numbers.

    :param numbers: List of numbers.
    :return: Tuple containing the mean and standard deviation.
    """
```

- **Purpose:** This function calculates two statistical measures for a list of numbers: the mean (average) and the standard deviation.
- **Parameters:**
  - `numbers`: A list of numerical values (integers or floats) for which the mean and standard deviation are computed.
- **Returns:**
  - A tuple containing two values: the mean and the standard deviation of the list.

#### 2. **Mean Calculation**

```python
mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
```

- **Sum Calculation:** `sum(numbers)` computes the total sum of all the numbers in the list.
- **Length Calculation:** `len(numbers)` returns the number of elements in the list.
- **Mean Calculation:** The mean is obtained by dividing the sum by the number of elements. This gives the average value of the list.

#### 3. **Variance Calculation**

```python
variance = sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in numbers) / len(numbers)
```

- **Variance Purpose:** Variance measures how much the numbers in the list deviate from the mean. It is the average of the squared differences between each number and the mean.
- **Generator Expression:** `(x - mean) ** 2 for x in numbers` calculates the squared difference between each number `x` and the mean.
  - `x - mean` computes the deviation of each number from the mean.
  - `(x - mean) ** 2` squares this deviation.
- **Sum of Squared Deviations:** `sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in numbers)` adds up all these squared deviations.
- **Average Variance:** Dividing the sum by the number of elements (`len(numbers)`) gives the variance.

#### 4. **Standard Deviation Calculation**

```python
std_dev = variance ** 0.5
```

- **Purpose:** The standard deviation provides a measure of the spread of the numbers around the mean. It is the square root of the variance.
- **Square Root Calculation:** `variance ** 0.5` calculates the square root of the variance using the exponentiation operator.

#### 5. **Return Statement**

```python
return mean, std_dev
```

- **Tuple Return:** The function returns a tuple `(mean, std_dev)`, which includes both the mean and the standard deviation.

#### 6. **Example Usage**

```python
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
mean, std_dev = calculate_statistics(numbers)
print(f"Mean: {mean}")
print(f"Standard Deviation: {std_dev}")
```

- **Input List:** `numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]` defines a list of numerical values.
- **Function Call:** `mean, std_dev = calculate_statistics(numbers)` calls the function with the list and unpacks the returned tuple into `mean` and `std_dev`.
- **Output:** The `print` statements display the mean and standard deviation of the numbers.

### Summary

This program demonstrates how to:
- Define and use functions with multiple return values.
- Compute fundamental statistical measures (mean and standard deviation) from a list of numbers.
- Use list comprehensions and generator expressions for concise calculations.

The approach ensures that the calculations are both efficient and easy to understand, providing a clear and practical example of statistical analysis in Python.
