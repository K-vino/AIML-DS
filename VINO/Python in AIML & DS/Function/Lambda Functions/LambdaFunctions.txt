### 4. Lambda Functions

**Explanation:**
Lambda functions in Python are small, anonymous functions defined using the `lambda` keyword. They are used for simple operations where defining a full function would be unnecessary. Lambda functions are often used with functions like `map()`, `filter()`, and `sorted()`.

### Example Program: Sorting a List of Tuples

```python
data = [(1, 'a'), (3, 'c'), (2, 'b')]
sorted_data = sorted(data, key=lambda x: x[1])

print("Sorted data based on second element:", sorted_data)
```

**Details:**

1. **Lambda Function Definition:**

   ```python
   lambda x: x[1]
   ```

   - **Syntax:** `lambda arguments: expression`
   - **Purpose:** Defines an anonymous function (lambda) that takes one argument `x` and returns the second element of `x` (i.e., `x[1]`).
   - **Usage:** This lambda function is used as the key for sorting, specifying that the sorting should be based on the second element of each tuple.

2. **Using `sorted()` with Lambda:**

   ```python
   sorted(data, key=lambda x: x[1])
   ```

   - **Function:** `sorted()` is a built-in Python function that returns a new sorted list from the elements of any iterable (like a list or tuple).
   - **Argument:** `key=lambda x: x[1]` specifies a lambda function to extract the value to be used for sorting. In this case, it extracts the second element of each tuple.
   - **Result:** The list `data` is sorted based on the values provided by the lambda function (i.e., the second element of each tuple).

3. **Output:**

   ```python
   print("Sorted data based on second element:", sorted_data)
   ```

   - **Print Statement:** Displays the sorted list of tuples based on the second element.

### Breakdown of the Program:

1. **Define Data:**

   ```python
   data = [(1, 'a'), (3, 'c'), (2, 'b')]
   ```

   - A list of tuples is created. Each tuple contains an integer and a string.

2. **Sort Data:**

   ```python
   sorted_data = sorted(data, key=lambda x: x[1])
   ```

   - The `sorted()` function sorts the list `data` using the lambda function to determine the sorting key. The lambda function extracts the second element of each tuple (`x[1]`), so the list is sorted by these string values.

3. **Print Results:**

   ```python
   print("Sorted data based on second element:", sorted_data)
   ```

   - Prints the sorted list, showing that the tuples are ordered by the second element (the string values) in ascending order.

### Summary

- **Lambda Functions:** Provide a concise way to create small, one-off functions without the need for a full function definition.
- **Use Cases:** Commonly used as arguments to higher-order functions like `sorted()`, `map()`, and `filter()`.
- **Advantages:** They are useful for simple operations that donâ€™t require the overhead of named functions.

In this example, lambda functions are utilized effectively to sort a list of tuples by a specific criterion, demonstrating their practical use in data manipulation and sorting operations.
