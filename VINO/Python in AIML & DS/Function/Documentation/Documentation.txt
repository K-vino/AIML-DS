### Documentation in Python Functions

**Docstrings** are a way to document Python functions, classes, and modules. They provide a convenient way to include information about the purpose, parameters, and return values of a function. This documentation is enclosed within triple quotes (`"""..."""`) and is placed immediately after the function definition.

#### Example:

Here’s an example demonstrating how to use docstrings to document a Python function:

```python
def calculate_mean(numbers):
    """
    Calculate the mean of a list of numbers.

    :param numbers: List of numbers.
    :return: Mean of the numbers.
    """
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
```

#### Breakdown:

1. **Function Definition:**
   ```python
   def calculate_mean(numbers):
   ```
   - **Purpose:** Defines a function named `calculate_mean` that calculates the mean of a list of numbers.
   - **Parameter:**
     - `numbers`: The input to the function, expected to be a list of numbers.

2. **Docstring:**
   ```python
   """
   Calculate the mean of a list of numbers.

   :param numbers: List of numbers.
   :return: Mean of the numbers.
   """
   ```
   - **Purpose of the Docstring:**
     - Provides a description of what the function does.
     - Documents the parameters and return value, making the function easier to understand and use.

   - **Description:**
     ```python
     Calculate the mean of a list of numbers.
     ```
     - Briefly describes what the function does.

   - **Parameter Documentation:**
     ```python
     :param numbers: List of numbers.
     ```
     - `:param numbers:` Indicates that the `numbers` parameter is a list of numbers.

   - **Return Documentation:**
     ```python
     :return: Mean of the numbers.
     ```
     - `:return:` Describes what the function returns, which in this case is the mean of the numbers.

3. **Function Body:**
   ```python
   return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
   ```
   - **Purpose:** Computes the mean by summing all the numbers in the list and dividing by the count of numbers.

#### Usage Example:

```python
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
mean = calculate_mean(numbers)
print("Mean:", mean)
```

- **Explanation:**
  - Creates a list `numbers` with some values.
  - Calls the `calculate_mean` function with the list.
  - Prints the result, which is the mean of the numbers in the list.

### Benefits of Good Documentation:

1. **Clarity:** Helps other users (or yourself in the future) understand what the function is supposed to do.
2. **Maintainability:** Makes it easier to maintain and update code by providing clear information about each function.
3. **Usability:** Assists users in correctly using the function by documenting the expected parameters and return values.

### Summary:

Using docstrings to document your functions is a best practice in Python. It ensures that your code is easier to read, understand, and maintain. Always include a clear description of the function’s purpose, parameters, and return values to make your code more user-friendly and maintainable.
