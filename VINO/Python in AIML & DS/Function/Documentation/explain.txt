Sure! Let's create a Python program that includes detailed docstrings to document its functions. We will write a program that performs several statistical operations on a list of numbers, including calculating the mean, median, and standard deviation.

### Python Program with Documentation

```python
import statistics

def calculate_mean(numbers):
    """
    Calculate the mean of a list of numbers.

    :param numbers: List of numbers (list of int or float).
    :return: Mean of the numbers (float).
    """
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

def calculate_median(numbers):
    """
    Calculate the median of a list of numbers.

    :param numbers: List of numbers (list of int or float).
    :return: Median of the numbers (float or int).
    """
    return statistics.median(numbers)

def calculate_std_dev(numbers):
    """
    Calculate the standard deviation of a list of numbers.

    :param numbers: List of numbers (list of int or float).
    :return: Standard deviation of the numbers (float).
    """
    return statistics.stdev(numbers)

def main():
    """
    Main function to demonstrate the use of statistical functions.
    """
    numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

    mean = calculate_mean(numbers)
    median = calculate_median(numbers)
    std_dev = calculate_std_dev(numbers)

    print("Numbers:", numbers)
    print("Mean:", mean)
    print("Median:", median)
    print("Standard Deviation:", std_dev)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Breakdown of the Program:

1. **Imports:**
   ```python
   import statistics
   ```
   - **Purpose:** Imports the `statistics` module for calculating the median and standard deviation.

2. **Function Definitions:**
   - **`calculate_mean(numbers)`**
     ```python
     def calculate_mean(numbers):
         """
         Calculate the mean of a list of numbers.

         :param numbers: List of numbers (list of int or float).
         :return: Mean of the numbers (float).
         """
         return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
     ```
     - **Docstring:** Describes the purpose, parameters, and return value of the function.
     - **Functionality:** Computes the mean of the list of numbers by dividing the sum by the length of the list.

   - **`calculate_median(numbers)`**
     ```python
     def calculate_median(numbers):
         """
         Calculate the median of a list of numbers.

         :param numbers: List of numbers (list of int or float).
         :return: Median of the numbers (float or int).
         """
         return statistics.median(numbers)
     ```
     - **Docstring:** Documents the purpose, parameters, and return value of the function.
     - **Functionality:** Uses the `statistics.median()` function to compute the median.

   - **`calculate_std_dev(numbers)`**
     ```python
     def calculate_std_dev(numbers):
         """
         Calculate the standard deviation of a list of numbers.

         :param numbers: List of numbers (list of int or float).
         :return: Standard deviation of the numbers (float).
         """
         return statistics.stdev(numbers)
     ```
     - **Docstring:** Provides information about the functionâ€™s purpose, parameters, and return value.
     - **Functionality:** Uses the `statistics.stdev()` function to compute the standard deviation.

3. **Main Function:**
   ```python
   def main():
       """
       Main function to demonstrate the use of statistical functions.
       """
       numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

       mean = calculate_mean(numbers)
       median = calculate_median(numbers)
       std_dev = calculate_std_dev(numbers)

       print("Numbers:", numbers)
       print("Mean:", mean)
       print("Median:", median)
       print("Standard Deviation:", std_dev)
   ```
   - **Purpose:** Demonstrates how to use the statistical functions defined above.
   - **Process:**
     - Defines a list of numbers.
     - Calls each statistical function to calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation.
     - Prints the results.

4. **Program Entry Point:**
   ```python
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       main()
   ```
   - **Purpose:** Ensures that the `main()` function is executed when the script is run directly.

### Expected Output:

```
Numbers: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
Mean: 30.0
Median: 30
Standard Deviation: 15.81
```

- **Numbers:** Shows the list of numbers used for calculations.
- **Mean:** The average value of the numbers.
- **Median:** The middle value when the numbers are sorted.
- **Standard Deviation:** A measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of the numbers.

This program demonstrates how to create and document functions with clear docstrings, making it easier for others (and yourself) to understand and use your code.
